The AI engineer's work trajectory involved iteratively building an Ajax Systems configurator based on user requirements. Initially, the focus was on understanding the product lines through web scraping and then implementing a basic React frontend with a FastAPI backend to serve product data. Critical early issues included correcting  attributes for testing and integrating PDF export functionality. Throughout the process, the AI frequently declared the task complete, only for the user to highlight missing product data or incorrect branding. This led to multiple cycles of re-researching product details, particularly from Xortec GmbH's website, and updating the backend product database and frontend branding. The work demonstrates an iterative development approach, with a clear dependency on extensive data gathering and user-driven refinement of product completeness and corporate identity. The final state indicates an ongoing effort to ensure *all* products are accurately represented.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build an Ajax Systems Systemkonfigurator (system configurator). This application must differentiate between Ajax's Superiorline, Baseline, EN54, and Video product lines. It needs to accurately link all system parameters inherent to Ajax products. For easier product selection, the items should be visually presented with images, concise USPs (Unique Selling Propositions), and descriptions. A crucial constraint is that products can only be combined according to Ajax's specific compatibility prerequisites.

Key requirements clarified by the user include:
1.  **Product Data:** Must contain all genuine, current Ajax product data and implement a mechanism for regular, automatic updates.
2.  **Product Line Definitions:**
    *   **Superiorline:** For professional installers and specialists.
    *   **Baseline:** For simpler applications.
    *   **EN54:** A specialized product line for fire alarm systems.
    *   **Video:** Ajax's video surveillance product line.
3.  **Compatibility:** Compatibility rules are to be discovered by researching .
4.  **User Experience:** A step-by-step wizard is preferred for ease of use.
5.  **Reporting:** A PDF export function is required.
6.  **Branding:** The configurator's author must be Xortec GmbH, not Ajax, and the corporate identity (CI) should align with Xortec GmbH.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Application:** React.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.
-   **UI/UX:** Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling,  for toast notifications.
-   **Data Handling:** Web scraping (implicit) for gathering product data,  for API calls, Pydantic for data validation in FastAPI.
-   **Routing:**  for client-side navigation.
-   **Testing:**  attributes for UI testing,  for comprehensive testing.
-   **PDF Generation:** Client-side PDF export functionality.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>


-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core FastAPI application file.
    -   **Importance:** It defines the backend API endpoints for retrieving product data, handling product categories, and potentially processing PDF export requests. It integrates with MongoDB (via ) for data storage (though currently, data seems to be hardcoded/scraped into the file directly).
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Initial implementation to serve product data for different Ajax lines.
        -   Added logic for PDF generation (though the exact mechanism isn't fully detailed in the trajectory, it was updated for this feature).
        -   Updated extensively multiple times to incorporate a more comprehensive list of Ajax products, especially after user feedback regarding missing items and branding corrections.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: This is the main React component responsible for the entire user interface and application logic.
    -   **Importance:** It orchestrates the step-by-step configurator wizard, displays product categories and individual products, manages user selections, makes API calls to the FastAPI backend, and triggers the PDF export.
    -   **Changes Made:**
        -   Initial setup of the configurator UI, including displaying product categories (Superiorline, Baseline, EN54, Video).
        -   Extensive modifications to add  attributes to various interactive and display elements for testing purposes.
        -   Implemented the step-by-step wizard flow for product selection.
        -   Integrated client-side PDF export functionality.
        -   Updated to correct branding from Ajax Systems to Xortec GmbH in the UI.
        -   Continuously refined to display the expanding list of Ajax products as sourced from the backend.

-   **/app/frontend/src/components/ui/**: This directory contains pre-built Shadcn UI components.
    -   **Importance:** Provides a consistent, modern, and accessible set of UI elements (e.g., Button, Input, Card, Dialog) that are used throughout the  to build the configurator's interface.

-   **/.env files (frontend/.env, backend/.env)**: These files store environment-specific variables.
    -   **Importance:** Crucial for configuring backend and frontend URLs ( for frontend,  for backend) without hardcoding, ensuring easy deployment and adherence to Kubernetes ingress rules.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Complete Product Data:** Ensure *all* genuine and current Ajax products are accurately included and displayed in the configurator, cross-referencing with  and other Ajax resources.
-   **Automatic Updates:** Implement a mechanism for regularly and automatically updating the product data.
-   **Compatibility Rules:** Thoroughly define and enforce Ajax product compatibility rules within the configurator logic.
-   **PDF Export Verification:** Fully verify the PDF export function to ensure it correctly captures all selected system parameters and adheres to Xortec GmbH branding.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug report from the user regarding the incompleteness of Ajax product data. The user explicitly stated that very many Ajax products are still missing and directed the AI to cross-reference with .

The AI engineer acknowledged this, researched the Xortec website, confirmed the missing products, and identified the need to build a complete product database. Consequently, the  file in the backend was updated (). This update was specifically aimed at incorporating a more comprehensive list of products. The very last action taken was initiating a final screenshot () to verify if the updated  successfully loaded and presented all the previously missing products on the frontend.

Analyze the screenshot to confirm that all products are correctly loaded and displayed in the configurator.
