<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** 
The user wants a complete overhaul of the Ajax Systems Systemkonfigurator for their company, Xortec GmbH.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Complete Redesign:** The user wants a complete frontend redesign, taking graphical inspiration from the official Ajax website ().
2.  **Complete & Accurate Product Catalog:** The configurator must include *all* current Ajax products. The agent must scrape  to find and implement any missing products, especially Hubs, NVRs (recorders), and all associated components.
3.  **Structured Product Lines:** The products must be categorized into the following structure, including sub-lines:
    *   Intrusion (split into Superior and Baseline)
    *   Video (split into Superior and Baseline)
    *   EN54 (Fire Safety)
    *   Comfort and Automation
4.  **Strict Business Logic:**
    *   **Compatibility:** All product combinations must be strictly validated as per Ajax's official compatibility rules.
    *   **Capacity:** The maximum device/camera capacity for each Hub and NVR must be strictly enforced.
5.  **UI/UX Fixes:** UI readability issues, such as white text on white buttons, must be fixed.
6.  **Branding:** The Xortec GmbH logo and the Impressum (legal notice) must be retained in the new design.
7.  **Data Source:**  is the **only** permitted source for product data, images, and specifications.
8.  **Goal:** The final configurator must be fully functional, accurate, and error-free.

**User's preferred language**: 
German. The next agent MUST respond in German.

**what currently exists?**
The agent initiated a complete overhaul of the application.
-   **Backend:** The product data architecture was refactored. Instead of a hardcoded list in , products are now loaded from a separate Python file (). The FastAPI endpoints (, ) were updated to serve this new data structure.
-   **Frontend:** A major redesign was implemented. A new Ajax-inspired landing page and a new configurator component () were created and integrated into . The agent resolved several rendering issues (blank pages, syntax errors) and CORS problems that blocked images from loading.
-   **Current State:** Despite the agent's belief that the task was complete, the user pointed out critical flaws: the product catalog is incomplete (missing hubs, NVRs, and other components) and there are major UI readability issues (white text on white buttons). The application is visually redesigned but functionally incomplete and incorrect.

**Last working item**: 
- **Last item agent was working:** Addressing the user's feedback that the product catalog is incomplete and the UI is unreadable. The agent acknowledged the errors and began a new, more thorough data-gathering phase by scraping  to get a definitive list of all Hubs, NVRs, and components.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** After the data and UI fixes are implemented, the agent should first use curl to test the backend API endpoints. Then, it should use the screenshot tool to verify the frontend UI readability and product display. For a full verification,  would be appropriate.
- **User Testing Done:** Y (and it failed, revealing the current issues)

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Incomplete Product Catalog (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
-   **Issue 2: UI Readability Failure (P0 - HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Incomplete Product Catalog**
    -   **Description:** The user has explicitly stated that Hubs, NVRs (Rekorder), and other components are missing from the configurator. The current product database () is incomplete.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent created several new product database files, but none were complete. The last action was to re-scrape  to gather comprehensive data.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Consolidate the newly gathered data into a single, definitive new Python file (e.g., ).
        2.  Ensure every product is correctly assigned to the required product lines: , , , , , .
        3.  Update  to import data from this new file.
        4.  Update the Pydantic  model in  to include any newly discovered fields (e.g., , ).
        5.  Run the  endpoint and verify via  that  returns the complete list.
        6.  Modify  to correctly display all products.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The core purpose of the configurator is to allow selection from a complete product catalog. This is the user's primary requirement.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.

-   **Issue 2: UI Readability Failure**
    -   **Description:** The user reported unreadable UI elements, specifically Weiss auf weiss (white on white) buttons, making interaction impossible.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. The agent acknowledged the issue but has not started working on it.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Inspect the JSX and associated Tailwind CSS classes for buttons within .
        2.  Identify the component or state (e.g., default, hover, disabled) causing the contrast issue.
        3.  Modify the Tailwind CSS classes to ensure high contrast and readability (e.g., , , ).
        4.  Use the screenshot tool to confirm the fix across all button states.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The application is unusable if the user cannot see or interact with the controls.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete Product Database Overhaul (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent has just finished gathering data from . The next step is to process this raw data, structure it according to the user's required product lines, and create a new, final product data file in the backend.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will provide the backend with a complete and accurate dataset, which is the foundation for fixing the user's main complaint.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - **(P1) Implement Configurator Business Logic:** After the data is complete, the core logic of the configurator needs to be built in . This includes:
        - Filtering components based on the selected Hub/NVR.
        - Enforcing device and camera limits (, ).
        - Calculating the total configuration and displaying it in the summary.
    - **(P2) Implement Product Line Selection:** The UI must be updated to allow users to first select one of the main product lines (Intrusion, Video, etc.) and then the sub-line (Superior, Baseline), which will then determine the available Hubs/NVRs.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Backend Refactoring:** Replaced the hardcoded product list in  with a dynamic import from a separate Python file.
- **API Endpoint Updates:** Updated the  and  APIs.
- **Frontend Redesign:** Created a new Ajax-inspired  and  component and integrated them into .
- **Frontend Debugging:** Fixed multiple critical rendering and image-loading issues.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   The two primary issues, **Incomplete Product Catalog** and **UI Readability Failure**, were found by the user in the last interaction and are currently the top priority. The agent had prematurely marked the project as complete before these were identified.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Full-stack:** React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (used as a temporary store, data is re-initialized on startup).
-   **UI/Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
-   **Data Gathering:** Web scraping of  to collect product information.
-   **Backend:** Pydantic for data modeling and validation.

**key DB schema**
The data is defined by the Pydantic  model in . Key fields include:
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files**
-   **Created:**
    -   : The new, but flawed, product data source.
    -   : The new, work-in-progress configurator UI.
-   **Updated:**
    -   : Heavily modified to load product data from an external file and update API logic.
    -   : Completely refactored to implement the new two-stage UI (Landing Page -> Configurator).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user's confidence is low. Do not claim success until the features are complete and verified. Your immediate goal is to fix the two critical issues: incomplete data and unreadable UI.
-   **Data is King:** The absolute priority is creating a complete and accurate product database based on the recent scraping of . This database must be structured into the specific product lines the user requested.
-   **Fix the UI:** Address the white-on-white button issue immediately after fixing the data. The application is unusable otherwise.
-   Follow the user's specified product hierarchy: , , etc. This must be the primary structure for the configurator flow.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Demanded a full restructuring of the configurator with specific product lines (Intrusion/Video split into Superior/Baseline, etc.), accurate Hub capacities, restored images, and strict adherence to  data. Stressed the need for accuracy.
2.  **Agent:** Acknowledged and started a new analysis.
3.  **User (LATEST PENDING):** After the agent's implementation, the user reported it was still broken: **products are missing** (hubs, recorders, components) and the **UI is unreadable** (white text on white buttons). Demanded a full re-check and fix.
4.  **Agent:** Agreed with the user's assessment and started a new, more thorough data-gathering process.
5.  **Agent:** Confirmed the data-gathering is complete and is about to create the new, full product database.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The core functionality is broken. The product data is incomplete, and the UI has critical readability flaws. The business logic (compatibility/capacity checks) is not implemented.
-   **Mocked:** The current configurator UI is a scaffold. It displays some data but lacks the interactive logic required.</analysis>
